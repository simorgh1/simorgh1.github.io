        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Historical Figures application is an <b>AI Knowledge
          Assistant</b> that includes a rich database of People who have made
          significant contributions to our culture, science, and history.
          The application provides detailed information about each figure,
          including their biography, achievements, and impact on the
          society.

        </p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
          The application is designed as a familiar AI chat interface, in which
          the user could query for information about historical figures like
          Kings, Scientists, Poets and Writers. The queries could be asked in 4
          different categories:

          <li>
            <b>Biography:</b> Asking a question like 'Who was Saadi?' will
            return a short biography of the person.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Works:</b> When this category is chosen, asking a question about
            a Person, would return his achievements and greatest contributions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Timeline:</b> This category would return the timeline of the
            person, including his birth and death dates, and important events in
            his life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Default:</b> This category is designed to ask any question about
            a specific person.
          </li>
        </p>
        <h2>Technical specification</h2>
        <p>
          The application is a Python-based web application that is using

          main framework.

          is the main AI LLM which is responsible for generating the answers
          based on my created Historical Figures Dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Dataset is processed using
          <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/" target="_blank"
            >LLama-Index</a
          >

          <b>Name</b>, <b>Birth Date</b> in Solar Hijri and Gregorian Calendar,
          <b>Birth Place</b>, his/her <b>short Biography</b> and <b>Image</b>.
          It was created and maintained by Bahram Maravandi. It is also used in

        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <p>
